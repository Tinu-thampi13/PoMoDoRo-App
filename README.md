# Pomodoro Timer


## Introduction
The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool designed to help users stay focused and productive by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique, known as the Pomodoro Technique, encourages sustained concentration and is an effective method for managing time and improving productivity. The Pomodoro Timer app allows users to set a focus mode of a specific time, followed by a 5-minute break period, in a continuous cycle until their goal time is reached.
